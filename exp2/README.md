# Experiment 2: Shallow Neural Network for Binary Classification

## Aim
To implement a shallow neural network for binary classification using a non-linear dataset.

## Description
In this experiment, a shallow neural network with one hidden layer is implemented using TensorFlow.
The model is trained on the make_moons dataset, which is a non-linearly separable dataset.
Feature scaling is applied before training to improve performance.
The trained model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Files Description
- exp1B.py : Python program that implements the shallow neural network, trains the model,
  evaluates performance using different metrics, and displays the results.

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Result
The model successfully classifies the dataset and achieves good accuracy on test data.
